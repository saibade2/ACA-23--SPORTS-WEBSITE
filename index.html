                Delhi
                Kohli first played for Delhi Under-15 team in October 2002 in the 2002–03 Polly Umrigar Trophy. He became the 
                captain of the team for the 2003–04 Polly Umrigar Trophy. In late 2004, he was selected in the Delhi Under-17
                 team for the 2003–04 Vijay Merchant Trophy. Delhi Under-17s won the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy in which Kohli 
                 finished as the highest run-scorer with 757 runs from 7 matches at an average of 84.11 with two centuries.
                  In February 2006, he made his List A debut for Delhi against Services but did not get to bat.
                
                Kohli made his first-class debut for Delhi against Tamil Nadu in November 2006, at the age of 18, 
                he scored 10 runs in his debut innings. He came into the spotlight in December when he decided to play for his
                 team against Karnataka on the day after his father's death and went on to score 90. He went directly to the funeral 
                 after he got out in the match. He scored a total of 257 runs from 6 matches at an average of 36.71 in that season.
                
                India Under-19
                In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the 
                three-match ODI series against England Under-19s[29] and 49 in the three-match Test series.India Under-19 went on 
                to win both the series. In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. Kohli averaged 58 in the Test series
                 and 41.66 in the ODI series against Pakistan Under-19s.
                
                In April 2007, he made his Twenty20 debut and finished as the highest run-getter for his team in the Inter-State T20
                 Championship with 179 runs at an average of 35.80.[34] In July–August 2007, the India Under-19 team toured Sri Lanka. 
                 In the triangular series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, Kohli was the second highest run-getter
                  with 146 runs at an average of 29 from 5 matches.In the two-match Test series that followed, he scored 244 runs at an 
                  average of 122 including a century and a fifty.
                
                In February–March 2008, Kohli captained the victorious Indian team at the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. 
                Batting at number 3, he scored 235 runs in 6 matches at an average of 47 and finished as the tournament's third-highest run-getter
                 and one of the three batsmen to score a hundred in the tournament.He was instrumental in India's three-wicket semi-final win over
                  New Zealand Under-19s in which he took 2 wickets and scored 43 in the tense run-chase and was awarded the man of the match.

			<h1>Rise through the ranks</h1>
			<p> Raina was named captain and Kohli vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe
                 in May–June 2010, as many first-choice players skipped the tour. Kohli made 168 runs at an average of 42.00 
                 including two fifties, but India suffered three defeats in four matches and crashed out of the series. During 
                 the series, Kohli became the fastest Indian batsman to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket.He made his T20I debut
                  against Zimbabwe at Harare and scored an unbeaten 26. Later that month, Kohli batted at 3 in an Indian team 
                  throughout the 2010 Asia Cup and scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75.His struggles with form
                   continued in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where he averaged 15.
                
                
                Kohli batting in an ODI against New Zealand in December 2010
                Despite the poor run of form, Kohli was retained in the ODI squad for a three-match series against
                Australia in October, and in the only completed match of the series at Visakhapatnam, scored his third ODI century–118
                off 121 balls–which helped India reach the target of 290 after losing the openers early.[81][48] Winning the man of
                the match, he admitted that he was under pressure to keep his place in the team after failures in the two previous
                series.Part of a largely inexperienced team for the home ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored a
                match-winning 104-ball 105, his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession, in the first game,[84] and followed
                it up with 64 and 63* in the next two matches. India completed a 5–0 whitewash of New Zealand, while Kohli's 
                performance in the series helped him become a regular in the ODI team and made him a strong contender for a
                spot in India's World Cup squad. He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, with 995 runs from 25
                matches at an average of 47.38 including three centuries and seven fifties.
                Kohli was India's leading run-getter in the five-match ODI series of the South African tour in January 2011,
                with 193 runs at an average of 48.25 including two fifties, both in Indian defeats. During the series, he jumped 
                to number two spot on the ICC Rankings for ODI batsmen, and was named in India's 15-man squad for the World Cup.
                The inclusion of both Kohli and Raina in the World Cup squad resulted in speculations about which of the two 
                 batsmen will make it to the playing eleven. Days before India's first match of the tournament, Indian captain Dhoni
                  indicated that the in-form Kohli is likely to be preferred over Raina.
                
                Kohli played in every match of India's successful World Cup campaign. He scored an unbeaten 100, his fifth ODI century,
                 in the first match against Bangladesh and became the first Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut.
                 In the next four group matches he had low scores of 8, 34, 12 and 1 against England, Ireland, Netherlands and South
                  Africa respectively. Having returned to form with 59 against the West Indies, he scored only 24 and 9 in the 
                  quarter-final against Australia and semi-final against Pakistan respectively.In the final against Sri Lanka at
                   Mumbai, he scored 35, sharing an 83-run partnership with Gambhir for the third wicket after India had lost both 
                   openers within the seventh over chasing 275.This partnership is regarded as "one of the turning points 
                   in the match",as India went on to win the match by six wickets and lift the World Cup for the first time since 
                   1983.</p>

				<h1>setting records</h1>
				<p>Kohli stood-in as the captain for the first ODI of the triangular series in the West Indies after Dhoni injured
                 himself during the match. India lost the match by one wicket, and Dhoni was subsequently ruled out of the series 
                with Kohli being named the captain for the remaining matches. In his second match as captain, Kohli scored his
                first century as captain, making 102 off 83 balls against the West Indies at Port of Spain in a bonus point win for India.
                Many senior players, including Dhoni, were rested for the five-match ODI tour of Zimbabwe in July 2013, with Kohli 
                being appointed captain for an entire series for the first time. In the first game of the series at Harare, he struck 115
                runs from 108 balls, helping India chase down the target of 229 and winning the man of the match award.He batted on two
                more occasions in the series in which he had scores of 14 and 68*.India completed a 5–0 sweep of the series; their first in an
                 away ODI series.
                Kohli had a successful time with the bat in the seven-match ODI series against Australia. After top-scoring with 61 in the
                opening loss at Pune, he struck the fastest century by an Indian in ODIs in the second match at Jaipur. Reaching the 
                milestone in just 52 balls and putting up an unbroken 186-run second-wicket partnership with Rohit Sharma that came in 17.2
                overs, Kohli's innings of 100* helped India chase down the target of 360 for the loss of one wicket with more than six 
                overs to spare. This chase was the second-highest successful run-chase in ODI cricket at the time, while Kohli's knock became 
                the fastest century against Australia and the third-fastest in a run-chase. He followed that innings with 68 in the next                  
                match at Mohali in another Indian defeat,before the next two matches were washed out by rain.In the sixth ODI at
                Nagpur, he struck 115 off only 66 balls to help India successfully chase the target of 351 and level the series 2–2 and won
                the man of the match. He reached the 100-run mark in 61 balls, making it the third-fastest ODI century by an Indian 
                batsman, and also became the fastest batsman in the world to score 17 hundreds in ODI cricket. India clinched the
               series after winning the last match in which he was run out for a duck. At the conclusion of the series, Kohli moved
               to the top position in the ICC ODI batsmen rankings for the first time in his career.
               Kohli batted twice in the two-match Test series against the West Indies, and had scores of 3 and 57 being dismissed
               by Shane Shillingford in both innings.This was also the last Test series for Tendulkar and Kohli was expected
              to take Tendulkar's number 4 batting position after the series.In the first game of the three-match ODI series that 
              followed at Kochi, Kohli made 86 to seal a six-wicket win and won the man of the match. During the match, he also
              equalled Viv Richards' record of becoming the fastest batsman to make 5,000 runs in ODI cricket, reaching the landmark
              in his 114th innings. He missed out on his third century at Visakhapatnam in the next match, after being dismissed for
              99 playing a hook shot off Ravi Rampaul. India lost the match by two wickets,but took the series 2–1 after
              winning the last match at Kanpur. With 204 runs at 68.00, Kohli finished the series as the leading run-getter and was
              awarded the man of the series..
